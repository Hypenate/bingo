# Bingo

An Angular Application to use for tech-sessions and presentations

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing. 

### Quick Start

Run all tests:
```bash
npm run e2e
```

### Available Test Commands

Run tests in UI mode (interactive):
```bash
npm run e2e:ui
```

Run tests in headed mode (see the browser):
```bash
npm run e2e:headed
```

Debug tests:
```bash
npm run e2e:debug
```

Generate tests using Codegen:
```bash
npm run e2e:codegen
```

### Advanced Options

Run tests in a specific browser:
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```
